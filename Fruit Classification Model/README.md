# Fruit Image Classification
## Project Overview
This project implements a fruit image classification model using deep learning techniques. The goal is to classify images of various fruits into their respective categories. The project leverages machine learning and computer vision libraries to preprocess the images and train a model for accurate classification.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various fruit images categorized into different classes. Each class corresponds to a specific fruit. This project uses a publicly available dataset (or a custom dataset if specified) for training and testing the model.

## Features
Image preprocessing using OpenCV and PIL libraries.
Data augmentation to improve model robustness.
Deep learning model implementation using TensorFlow or Keras.
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualizations of training progress (loss and accuracy over epochs).
## Requirements
Before running the project, ensure that the following libraries and dependencies are installed:

Python 3.x
NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
TensorFlow or Keras
scikit-learn

## Usage
Preprocessing: The images are loaded and preprocessed (resized, normalized, etc.) before being fed into the model.

Model Training: The notebook contains code to define and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on the fruit images dataset. To run the training:

Open the Jupyter Notebook (fruit-image-classification.ipynb).
Ensure the dataset path is correctly specified in the notebook.
Execute the cells in sequence.
Model Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated on the test set, and key performance metrics are displayed.

Prediction: The trained model can be used to predict the class of new fruit images.

## Jupyter Notebook
The fruit-image-classification.ipynb notebook contains the following key sections:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Handles the loading of images and their labels.
Data Augmentation: Applies random transformations to improve model generalization.
Model Definition: Defines the architecture of the deep learning model.
Model Training: Trains the model using the training data.
Evaluation: Evaluates the model on test data and provides performance metrics.
Prediction: Uses the trained model to classify new images.

## Results
After training, the model's performance is evaluated, and results such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are provided. These metrics help in understanding the model's effectiveness.

## Future Work
Enhance the model by tuning hyperparameters.
Use more advanced architectures such as ResNet or EfficientNet.
Explore transfer learning to improve classification performance on small datasets.
